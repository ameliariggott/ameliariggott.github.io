    "title": "Has the addition of UCLA and USC made the Big Ten Women’s Swimming Conference more competitive?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "After moving from the Pac-12, the University of California, Los Angles (UCLA) and the University Southern California (USC) both made the decision to join the Big Ten Conference. The Big Ten has always been one of the most competitive swimming conferences in the nation, with top teams like Ohio State and Indianna.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2024-2025 season, the first with the new additions, we can see that times are getting faster across multiple events. The question is: Is it fair to say that times have improved because of the addition of UCLA and USC, or is this simply part of the trend in collegiate swimming?\nTo answer this question, we need to take a deep dive into the championship times from 2022 and compare them with 2025, focusing on the women’s 1,650-yard freestyle event-the most testing endurance race.\nUsing the SwimmeR package in R, I imported times from PDFs, which is the common format for meet results. This then allowed me to extract places and easily compare times from different years. I then looked at the top 24 finishers (scoring positions) over the past four years to see if there are any trends.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(SwimmeR)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"data/data_big_ten_swim (1).csv\")\n\nfiltered_data &lt;- data |&gt;\n  filter(season %in% c(2022, 2023, 2024, 2025)) |&gt;\n  filter(place &gt;=1, \n    place&lt;=24) |&gt;\n    filter(!is.na(final_in_seconds))\n\nlong_data &lt;-filtered_data |&gt;\n  filter(\n    event == \"Women 1650 Yard Freestyle\",\n    place &gt;=1, \n    place&lt;=24, \n    !is.na(final_in_seconds)\n  )\n\nggplot()+\n    geom_line(data=long_data, \n              aes(x=season, \n                  y=final_in_seconds, group=place), \n              color=\"grey\", \n              alpha=.3) +\n  \n    geom_line(data = filter(long_data, place %in% c(1)), aes(x=season, y=final_in_seconds, group=place), color=\"red\") +\n  \n    geom_line(data = filter(long_data, place %in% c(8)), aes(x=season, y=final_in_seconds, group=place), color=\"blue\") +\n  \n    geom_line(data = filter(long_data, place %in% c(24)), aes(x=season, y=final_in_seconds, group=place), color=\"green\") +\n  \n geom_text(aes(x=2025.35, y=945, label = \"Red = 1st Place\"), colour=\"red\") +\n geom_text(aes(x=2025.35, y=965, label = \"Blue = 8th Place\"), colour=\"blue\") +\n geom_text(aes(x=2025.40, y=991, label = \"Green = 24th Place\"), colour=\"green\") +\n  \n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2022, 2025.75)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14, hjust = 0),\n      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0),\n      plot.caption = element_text(face = \"italic\", hjust = 0)\n    ) +\n  \n  labs(title = \"Women 1650 Yard Freestyle Time from 2022-2025\", \n       subtitle = \"Showing trends for top 16 times at the Big Ten Women's Swimming Championships\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Time (seconds)\", \n    caption = (\"By:Amelia Riggott | Source:Big Ten Swimming & Diving Championships Results 2022-2025, using SwimmeR\")\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a clear improvement in times for both 8th and 16th place finishers, but not so much for 1st place.

    "section": "",
    "text": "It is known that men’s college basketball has undeniably shifted toward a faster-paced game with heightened emphasis on floor spacing and 3-point shooting. This ‘pace and space’ strategy focuses on offensive efficiency by maximizing possessions and emphasizing high-value shots. But has this same strategic approach reshaped women’s college basketball in the same way?\nIn this context, pace refers to the average number of possessions a team has per game. If the women’s game has taken up this approach, we would expect to see an increase in both pace and the number of 3-point attempts over the seasons dating back.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(wehoop)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nwork &lt;- read_csv(\"data/test copy.csv\")\n\ngamesplayed2 &lt;- work |&gt; \n  group_by(team_display_name, season) |&gt; \n  summarise(games_played = n(), \n    total_shots = sum(field_goals_attempted, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_3pt_attempts = sum(three_point_field_goals_attempted, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_3pt_made = sum(three_point_field_goals_made, na.rm = TRUE), \n    field_g_att = sum(field_goals_attempted, na.rm = TRUE),\n    field_t_att = sum(free_throws_attempted, na.rm = TRUE),\n    offensive_rebounds = sum(offensive_rebounds, na.rm = TRUE),\n    turnovers = sum(turnovers, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    possessions = field_g_att + 0.44 * field_t_att - offensive_rebounds + turnovers,\n    pace = possessions / games_played, \n    space = total_3pt_attempts / total_shots\n  ) |&gt;\n    filter(games_played &gt;10) |&gt;\n      ungroup()\n\n\nrecent_seasons &lt;- gamesplayed2 |&gt; filter(season &gt; 2020)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=gamesplayed2, aes(x=space, y=pace), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=recent_seasons, aes(x=space, y=pace), color=\"blue\", alpha=.3) +   \n  geom_text_repel(data=gamesplayed2, aes(x=space, y=pace, label=team_display_name), size=3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Pace and 3-point shota by Team and Season\",\n    subtitle = \"A look at team trends in 3-point shooting and game pace across past &lt;span style='color:blue;'&gt;recent&lt;/span&gt; seasons.\",\n    x = \"3-point shooting rate\",\n    y = \"Pace (Possessions per Game)\",\n    color = \"Season\", \n    caption = (\"**By:** Amelia Riggott | **Source:** wehoop: The SportsDataverse's R Package for Women's Basketball Data\")\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(),\n    plot.caption = element_markdown()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the pace of women’s college basketball games and the rate of 3-point shot attempts hasn’t changed that much, if anything since 2017. This suggests that the pace and space strategy seen in the men’s game hasn’t taken over the women’s game to the same extent.\nIf pace hasn’t significantly changed, another question we can ask is whether shot selection has. Can we see a shift towards players taking more 3-point attempts compared to 2-point attempts since 2017?\n\n\nCode\ntwo_point_attempts &lt;- gamesplayed2 |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    two_point_att = field_g_att - total_3pt_attempts) |&gt;\n  select(season, two_point_att, total_3pt_attempts) |&gt;\n  group_by(season) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    two_point_att = sum(two_point_att, na.rm = TRUE), \n    total_3pt_attempts = sum(total_3pt_attempts, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -season, \n    names_to = \"Type\",\n    values_to = \"Total\"\n    )\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_bar(data=two_point_attempts, aes(x=season, weight=Total, fill=Type)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"red\", \"blue\"), labels = c(\"Total 3-point shots\", \"Total 2-point shots\"), name=\"Shot types\") + \n  coord_flip() + \ntheme_minimal() + \n    labs(\n    title = \"Shot Selection Trends by Season\",\n    subtitle = \"Visualizing the change between 2-point and 3-point field goal attempts over time.\",\n    x = \"Number of shots\",\n    y = \"Season\",\n    caption = \"**By:** Amelia Riggott | **Source:** wehoop: The SportsDataverse's R Package for Women's Basketball Data\") + \n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.caption = element_markdown()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData from 2017 to this current season shows no change in the amount of 2-point and 3-point attempts, apart from the anomaly during 2021, which was likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis indicates that the pace and space strategy, which has taken over the men’s basketball game, has not been adopted by the women’s.\nHowever, even if this strategy hasn’t had a dramatic impact on women’s basketball as a whole. Can we see if certain teams have adopted this playing style and whether these teams have a major impact in the NCAA?\n\n\nCode\nteams &lt;- gamesplayed2 |&gt; \n  select(season, team_display_name, pace) |&gt; \n  filter(season == 2017 | season == 2025) |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = season, \n    values_from = pace\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(difference = `2025` - `2017`) |&gt; \n  top_n(10, wt=difference)\n\nteams |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(difference)) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    team_display_name =\"Team\",\n    difference = \"Difference\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Which Teams have changed their pace the most since 2017?\",\n    subtitle = \"LSU and Rutgers among the teams whose pace has increased the most.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Amelia Riggott  |  **Source:** wehoop: The SportsDataverse's R Package for Women's Basketball Data\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#461D7C\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = team_display_name == \"LSU Tigers\")\n    ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#CC0033\"), \n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ), \n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = team_display_name == \"Rutgers Scarlet Knights\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich Teams have changed their pace the most since 2017?\n\n\nLSU and Rutgers among the teams whose pace has increased the most.\n\n\nTeam\n2017\n2025\nDifference\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Central Eagles\n66.60296\n79.57481\n12.971852\n\n\nNiagara Purple Eagles\n66.38800\n78.71143\n12.323429\n\n\nLSU Tigers\n67.54500\n77.03459\n9.489595\n\n\nSamford Bulldogs\n62.82400\n72.09032\n9.266323\n\n\nOral Roberts Golden Eagles\n69.57630\n78.49161\n8.915317\n\n\nUtah State Aggies\n66.61793\n75.39862\n8.780690\n\n\nArizona State Sun Devils\n65.51879\n74.13250\n8.613712\n\n\nUtah Valley Wolverines\n64.36828\n72.29379\n7.925517\n\n\nMemphis Tigers\n66.83586\n74.56143\n7.725567\n\n\nRutgers Scarlet Knights\n64.26267\n71.81250\n7.549833\n\n\n\nBy: Amelia Riggott | Source: wehoop: The SportsDataverse’s R Package for Women’s Basketball Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemarkably, powerhouse programs like LSU and Rutgers have shown a move toward a faster paced gameplay. LSU, in particular, made the Elite Eight in the 2025 NCAA tournament, being run by one of the most recognizable coaches in college basketball due to her often-controversial style, Kim Mulkey.\nIt’s extremely interesting that the ‘Pace and Space’ strategy has not yet taken over women’s college basketball on an overall scale. But programs like LSU and Rutgers are starting to change their gameplay. Whether this becomes a trend that other programs will start leaning toward, we will see. But it raises the question: will the women’s game at some point match the strategic shifts that the men’s game has seen?"
