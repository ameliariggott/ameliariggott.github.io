    "section": "",
    "text": "After moving from the Pac-12, University of California, Los Angles (UCLA) and University Southern California (USC) both made the decision to join the Big Ten Conference. The Big Ten has always been one of the most competitive swimming conferences in the nation, with top teams like Ohio State and Indianna.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2024-2025 season-the first with the new additions-we can see that times are getting faster across multiple events. The question is: Is it fair to say that times have improved because of the addition of UCLA and USC, or is this simply part of the trend in collegiate swimming?\nTo answer this question, we need to take a deep dive into the championship times from 2022 and compare them with 2025, focusing on the women’s 1,650-yard freestyle event-the most testing endurance race.\nUsing the SwimmeR package in R, I imported times from PDFs, which is the common format for meet results. This then allowed me to extract placing and easily compare times from different years. I looked at the top 24 finishers (scoring positions) over the past four years to see if there are any trends.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.4     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(SwimmeR)\n\n\nColumns 'Prelims_Time' and 'Finals_Time' have been changed to 'Prelims' and 'Finals' respectively.

Yes, they take up two scoring spots and make times faster. However, they don’t account for a full 20-second difference.\nThis proves that while UCLA and USC have made an impact, it ultimately falls down to the trend that collegiate swimming is simply getting faster."
